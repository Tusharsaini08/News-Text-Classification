# NEWS TEXT CLASSIFICATION.
Introduction
Text classification also known as text tagging or text categorization is the process of categorizing text into organized groups.
By using natural language processing (NLP),text classifiers can automatically analyze text and then assign a set of pre-defined tags or categories based on its content.

A news article discusses current or recent news of either general interest (i.e. daily newspapers) or on a specific topic (i.e. political or trade news magazines, club newsletters, or technology news websites). We must have seen the news divided into categories when we go to a news website. Some of the popular categories that you’ll see on almost any news website are tech, entertainment, sports, etc. Every news website classifies the news article before publishing it so that every time visitors visit their website can easily click on the type of news that interests them. For example, I like to read the latest technology updates, so every time I visit a news website, I click on the technology section. But you may or may not like to read about technology, you may be interested in politics, business, entertainment, or maybe sports. Currently, the news articles are classified by hand by the content managers of news websites. But to save time, they can also implement a machine learning model on their websites that reads the news headline or the content of the news and classifies the category of the news.

# Text Classification
Text classification datasets are used to categorize natural language texts according to content. For example, think classifying news articles by topic, or classifying book reviews based on a positive or negative response. Text classification is also helpful for language detection, organizing customer feedback, and fraud detection.
While this process is time-consuming when done manually, it can be automated with machine learning models.
Category classification, for news, is a multi-label text classification problem. The goal is to assign one or more categories to a news article. A standard technique in multi-label text classification is to use a set of binary classifiers.
# Know about Data
For the task of news classification with machine learning, I have collected a dataset from Kaggle, which contains news articles including their headlines and categories.
# Data Fields
  Article Id – Article id unique given to the record
  Article – Text of the header and article
  Category – Category of the article (tech, business, sport, entertainment, politics)
 
# Data Cleaning and Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is the process of transforming raw data into an understandable format. It is also an important step in data mining as we cannot work with raw data. The quality of the data should be checked before applying machine learning or data mining algorithms.
# Learning Outcome 
By doing this project I got to know about the potential of Machine learning in improving our lifestyle. I got to know about various python libraries which are very useful. I also learned about various web technologies and because of them this project was possible.
# Outcome- 
The model is able to predict and classify the news text into 5 unique categories(i.e. political , business, technology, sports and entertainment ).
# Improvement - 
The model can be improved by providing a greater dataset which will help the model to learn more accurately.
